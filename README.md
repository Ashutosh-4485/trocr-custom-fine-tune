## 🚀 TrOCR Fine-Tuning on Custom Dataset

This repository contains a hands-on notebook demonstrating how to fine-tune the [TrOCR model](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/trocr-base-stage1) from Hugging Face Transformers on a custom OCR dataset.

### 📘 Overview

This tutorial walks through:

- 🔍 Custom OCR dataset preparation
- 🧠 Loading and fine-tuning `TrOCRForCausalLM`
- 🏋️ Training using Hugging Face `Trainer` API
- 📊 Evaluation and inference on sample images
- 
### 📂 Files

### Note
Make sure to update all dataset paths, image folder locations, and any relevant configuration to suit your own directory structure and dataset format.
Example: Change "images/sample1.jpg" to your actual image directory, and adjust paths in the notebook accordingly.
